# NW-Montana-Bush-Trip
 Montana, known as "Big Sky Country" and "The Treasure State", has plenty of beautiful places to explore via air. Western Montana has numerous mountain lakes and rivers to explore, with wilderness areas that are beautiful, and the stunning Glacier National Park. This trip will take us from the northwestern border with Canada, on a tour through Glacier, south down some big and beautiful wilderness areas, and then circling back up north along many rivers and valleys ending relatively close to where we started.

Optional Intro Leg: Troy (57S) to Eureka (88M)
Take off, fly south-east over the town of Troy and following the Kootenai River east. US Hwy 2 runs alongside the river. The Kootenay River is one of the uppermost major tributaries of the Columbia River, the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. Approximately 15 nm of river flying and you will fly over Libby, MT, once a mining and timber city, it now is mostly a tourist attraction. Keep following the winding river east and as it turns north, you will fly over the Libby Dam. Continue up the large reservoir north, known as Lake Koocanusa. You'll pass just one brdige, the Koocanusa Bridge (longest and tallest in Montana) just before you reach the towns of Rexford and Eureka on your right. Rexford is just before reservoir widens and a valley appears headed southeast. Although Eureka is deeper into the valley, the the Eureka airport is located within a few miles of the Canadian border, so keep heading along the eastern shore of the reservoir until you see a series of lakes, with the airport at the northeastern edge and just west of Hwy 93, running north to the Canadian border.

Scenic route through GNP, up North Fork of the Flathead River (which serves as GNP boundary). Over both Kintla Lake and Upper Kintla Lake with Long Knife Peak on the left. Between Gardner Point and Boulder Peak over Lake Francis and Lake Janet, around the Citadel Peaks, then south to meet with the McDonald Creek all the way to the big, majestic, and beautiful McDonald Lake, landing at Ryan Field.

Leg 4: Ryan Field (2MT1) to Schafer USFS (8U2)
We are headed to Schafer Meadows airstrip. It is co-located with the USFS Schafer Ranger Station in the Great Bear Wilderness, more than 30 miles from any road and without electricity. After take off fly immediately north where you will very quickly see a river, a road, and railroad tracks headed into the mountains to the east at first, but primarily to the south for this trip. The highway is US Hwy 2 and the railway is used heavily by BNSF along one of the most difficult railway passes in the country, Maria's Pass. We will leave the railway before Maria's Pass but are headed to some truly spectacular terrain. The river you we are following is the Middle Fork of the Flathead River. Plan on landing to the north.

Leg 5: Schafer USFS (8U2) to Benchmark (3U7)
As you no doubt noticed after that landing, the only real option is to both land and take off to the north. So that is what we are going to do. We will take as much time flying north as needed to gain enough altitude to make a 180 and continue southeast down (really up) the Middle Fork of the Flathead River. The river will start to get small really fast. As the river turns southward within the first 3 miles, we will be passing Gable Peaks on our right at which time we will be crossing from the Great Bear Wilderness into the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Continuing south the river slowly fades but continue following the valley south. At the "Y" Clack Mountain is in front of us, and while the valley to the right looks bigger, head down the left valley southeast for about 5 miles, at which point a bigger valley will open up into the Sun River Game Preserve. Keep an eye open, you may spot some wildlife! Hug the mountains on your right, and as a river creeps towards your location a valley will appear on your right. Big bonus if you see the "unverified" guard station  at this intersection. Follow the valley to the west. Our next landmark is one that will be apparent when you get to it. The landmark is a 12 mile long cliff face made of limestone known as the "Chinese Wall." We will follow this until it ends in a "Y", go left and we will very quickly see the Sun River.
